    <div class="suicide">
        <p class="idk">It's important to spread awarness on suicide because countless people are constantly taking
            their lives
            everyday. It's mostly because they arent getting the treatment they require and because the subject isn't 
            talked about enough in our current world. To stop suicide, we must talk about it, spread awarness
            to other platforms letting people
            know that we do care about them and that we're trying to help them get the treatment they need so please
            after you read, spread the word that suicide is a thing and it can affect others.</p>

        <h1>Why It's Important to Talk About Suicide</h1>

    <div class="suicide">
        <p class="idk">It's important to spread awarness of suicide, because countless people are constantly taking
            their lives
            everyday. This comes from the fact that people aren't getting the treatment they require and from not having enough people talking 
            about how serious of a problem this really is. That is why we must show them we really care talking about this problem.</p>
