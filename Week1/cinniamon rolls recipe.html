<li>first you need milk either 2%, whole milk or almond milk</li>
<br>
<li>next you will need granulated sugar this will make sure to sweeten the cinniamon rolls </li>
<br>
<li>after you do that you will need quick rise yeast that will help the cinniamon rolls rise faster if you 
don't have quick rise yeast you can active dry yeast but the cinniamon rolls will slightly take longer to rise </li>
<br>
<li>next you will need butter, you can either use salted butter or unsalted butter. you will need it for the 
dough, filling and icing</li>
<br>
<li>next you will need 1 eggs + plus 1 egg yulk for the perfect texture and rich consistency in the dough</li>
<br>
<li>next you will need bread flour to help keep the cinnamon rolls soft and fluffy</li>
<br>
<li>after adding the bread flour you will need to add brown sugar but if you want you can add dark brown sugar
for more robust molasses sweet flavor in those cinnamon swirls</li>
<br>
<il> next you will need salt because without salt tastes very plain and in addition, salt also helps to control
 yeast in cinnamon roll recipes</il>
 <br>
 <il> lastly for the icing, you will just need cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla.</il>
